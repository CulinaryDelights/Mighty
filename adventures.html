                Mighty Miracle Feinstein was adopted from the Santa Cruz SPCA on January 15, 2017 by his
                dog-mom Amanda. She put him in a crate in the car, drove over the Santa Cruz mountains, and
                then right out to dinner! He was so well-behaved even just a few hours after being adopted.
                Mighty was happily adjusting to his new life in Mountain View California. Unexpectedly,
                Amanda needed to take a trip to New Jersey to see her family, but Mighty couldn’t come. So,
                she left him with a sweet couple for a few days. She left Mighty with his blanket, food, and
                stuffed animals. Two days later, Amanda got a call from the couple saying that Mighty had run
                away. Devastated, Amanda called her friends, her dog walker, and posted on Facebook to start
                a search party for Mighty. She stayed up all night long, worried sick. Several friends were out in
                the middle of the night trying to find Mighty. One friend even spotted him running down El
                Camino Real in Mountain View, a very busy street, but couldn’t catch him. He was too fast!
                Amanda called all the local businesses asking them to be on the look-out for Mighty. About 36
                hours later, the couple watching Mighty called her and said they heard a noise at about 3am
                and went outside to see what it was. It was Mighty! He found his way back and was eating the
                food they left him outside. They said he was filthy but he jumped up into their bed and fell right
                asleep. It was a miracle! That’s how Mighty got his middle name.
                Some may wonder, why did Mighty run away? Was he missing Amanda and trying to find his
                way back home? Was he afraid being in a new environment? Or was Mighty on a vision quest –
                a journey he needed to take to let go of his past and start a new life with his new dog mom?
                We will never know.<br><br>
                Today, Mighty is a happy and healthy dog living in Redwood City CA. He has been certified by
                the American Kennel Club and previously worked as a therapy dog with his dog mom who is a
                psychologist. He is loved by all.<br><br>
